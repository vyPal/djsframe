Commando was an awesome framework, but sadly, with the releas of Discord.js v13 the framework was no longer going to be supported. Since commando was a great library, and I liked many things about it (speed, ease of use, ...) I decided to make DJSFrame, a simple framework for the Discord.js library, that would feel familiar, be easy to use, but also had all the great new features that they added in Discord.js v13"
